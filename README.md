# richeck
This tool allows you to simply see the EC2 and ElastiCache nodes you have reserved on amazon.

Motivation:

How many instances are currently reserved in the regions? and how necessary is it? I wanted to see it simply. The "RI Coverage Report" (https://aws.amazon.com/tr/aws-cost-management/reserved-instance-reporting/) was showing hourly. Seeing the usage and reserved numbers as simple helped me to make a clear decision.


## Usage

> richeck --region=eu-central-1

or

> richeck --json


Output:
